REMOTE ADMIN
=============

**The powerful tool for Agencies!**

*What is REMOTE ADMIN?* Well, have you ever created more websites with the same system and delivered them to different Providers? Remote Admin provides you the ability to add all your LUYA Websites into the REMOTE ADMIN and helps you to see:

+ Which Websites are outdated? (Reads the version and compares to current packagist version)
+ Displays you informations about Debug and other Server state informations
+ Get the count of online administration
+ Quick Link to the Luya instance

We will add more and more features in future to make your conrol panel over all LUYA websites one of the powerful LUYA tools!
